# Steps for Playing Tic-Tac-Toe game

- Two players are involved in the game
- Each player has to enter their names one by one (Note!  You can not leave your name empty)
- The board will be displayed on the screen and the first player will be asked for selecting an empty cell on the board by selecting 1 – 9 number (Note: You cannot enter the number above or below the given range or select occupied space)
- The first player’s move will be marked as  ‘X’ and the second player’s move will be marked as ‘O’
- Each play takes a turn to place either an 'X' or 'O' (a marker) on the board 
- The winner will be announced when all three cells horizontally or vertically or diagonally will be filled with either ‘X’ | ‘O’ 
- If there was no winner the game is considered a Tie.
- In both winning or draw conditions, the game will ask players whether or not they want to continue playing by selecting ‘Y’ as a positive response and any other character as a negative response.
- If the answer is positive, the board will reset and the first player continues playing.
- If the response was negative the “Thanks for the game”  message will be displayed and the game will be terminated.
